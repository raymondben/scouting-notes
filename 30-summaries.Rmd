# What information can we get from this data?

TBD. Examples of in-game stats and summaries from VBStats (built in), and via the untan.gl apps.

#### Principles
##
##- effort (opportunities)
##    - absolute numbers generally mean nothing (would you rather have a middle blocker who got 5 kill blocks, or one who got 10? What if the one who got 5 got them from 5 attempts, and the one who got 10 took 50 attempts?)
##
##For many downstream analyses (after the scouting is complete) it's important to be able to identify which player was responsible for particular actions. Absolute numbers generally aren't meaningful on their own (would you rather have a middle blocker who got 5 kill blocks, or one who got 10? What if the one who got 5 got them from 5 attempts, and the one who got 10 took 50 attempts?). We need to keep track of the number of times a particular player was in a given situation, if we want to evaluate their performance in that situation.
##
##In some cases, a player's "opportunities" are recorded in the data without any extra effort from the scout (e.g. the number of serves that a particular player made can be extracted from the data, and so their error rate (number of errors/number of serves) is straightforward to calculate. However, in other cases this may not be so easy. Take receptions, for example. If we were to scout a serve ace *without* also scouting the corresponding reception action, it would generally be difficult to figure out with certainty later on (purely from the scouted data) who the responsible receiver was. That in turn would mean that if we want to identify weak passers (e.g. from an opposition team so that we can target our serves, or from our own team so we can tailor our training appropriately) we might not be able to do so accurately.
